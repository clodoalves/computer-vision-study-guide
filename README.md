# computer-vision-study-guide

Hey, you guys!

This is a simple study repository with samples using Python for computer vision algorithms.

So far, this repo has samples for the following computer vision techniques:

- Face detection
    - Convolutional neural network (CNN)
    - Haarcascade
    - Histogram of oriented gradients (HOG)
- Face recognition
    - Local binary pattern histogram (LBPH)
- Object tracking
    - CSRT (Discriminative Correlation Filter with Channel and Spatial Reliability)
    - Kernal Correlation Filters (KCF)

## Used libs:
- OpenCV
- Dlib
- PIL
- NumPy

Please, add your datasets for use in the samples.
